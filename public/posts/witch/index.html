  <meta property="og:description" content="So Weapons (2025) has become the first “horror” film I watched in a cinema. I have not seen Barbarian (2022) yet but at some point I might see it. Cregger is great, so I’m sure Barbarian is going to be good as well. Weapons, though? I think it’s interesting enough to talk about, especially the discussion it is generating.
First things out of the way, I definitely enjoyed the film. I went in expecting a more mystery-horror-surreal film, but instead it was just a surreal-comedy-horror (note the order of classifiers, they are on purpose). I don’t care what genre it is at the end of the day because I think it was alright, and I had a good time. Cregger is a fan of Lynch and guys like that like to put undecipherable stuff on screen. Things the creators themselves do not know or think about putting it there, rather they just do it simply driven by their subconscious. One of such things in Weapons is this sudden surreal appearance of a giant assault rifle floating above a house. Hmm…">

>Barbarian (2022)</a>
 yet but at some point I might see it. Cregger is great, so I&rsquo;m sure <em>Barbarian</em> is going to be good as well. <em>Weapons</em>, though? I think it&rsquo;s interesting enough to talk about, especially the discussion it is generating.</p>
<p>First things out of the way, I definitely enjoyed the film. I went in expecting a more mystery-horror-surreal film, but instead it was just a surreal-comedy-horror (note the order of classifiers, they are on purpose). I don&rsquo;t care what genre it is at the end of the day because I think it was alright, and I had a good time. Cregger is a fan of Lynch and guys like that like to put undecipherable stuff on screen. Things the creators themselves do not know or think about putting it there, rather they just do it simply driven by their subconscious. One of such things in <em>Weapons</em> is this sudden surreal appearance of a giant assault rifle floating above a house. Hmm…</p>
<p>This is an American film. And part of the film extends beyonds its runtime, leaking into the reality. Let me post a &ldquo;real&rdquo; comment from reddit, because of course who knows what&rsquo;s &ldquo;real&rdquo; on internet anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I might be reading too much into the movie where kids rip off the face of a witch, but I kept thinking to myself why the movie is called Weapons and how the assault rifle in Brolin’s nightmare sequence ties into it. Then I fell down a mental rabbit hole.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With that imagery and a bunch of kids vanishing, this movie is obviously about school shootings in some way. But I think the movie takes it a step further and is really about right wing indoctrination and radicalization. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, there are multiple references to parasites in the movie, which is probably just referring to Gladys inserting and taking control of the household. But, I think that could represent the inserting of right-wing rhetoric into the minds of kids. Gladys zombifies Alex’s parents, which made me think of the absentee parents you see in these types of stories, oblivious to what is happening with their kid. Gladys also says that whatever she is doing to the parents (something with their souls?) isn’t enough for her , she needs kids. The right wing has been especially reliant in recent years in changing/gutting education and getting into the minds of young people (Gen Alpha and the younger end of Gen Z) in order for their ideology to remain and spread (like a parasite).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the line where Josh Brolin says something like “it’s weaponizing our kids” summarizes what Creeger is trying to say. This radicalization turns kids into weapons, sometimes even literally with shootings. I think it is also intentional how Gladys kills a gay couple in the middle of the movie (otherwise, why make Benedict Wong’s character gay?). I think Creeger is intentional in also showing that Alex is bullied and ostracized by his class, as similar things happen with a lot of young right wingers, whose anger and loneliness are exploited by influencers and the like. (This also may be the reason why in the beginning, one of the first lines of dialogue is about feeling angry and explaining how universal it can be).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This read isn’t perfect. I don’t know how a lot of the other characters really fit into this puzzle.  Alex, even though he is responsible partially for the missing kids, isn’t vengeful really or looking to hurt them (unlike a lot of school shooters) and only does what he does to save his parents. And also I don’t know why the right wing influences would be represented by an old witch instead of something else.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, thought that would be worthwhile to say because I’ve seen people say this movie isn’t about anything, but I don’t think that’s the case.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: Ok everyone I literally open this thing by saying “I might be reading into this too much”. I literally say my read has holes in it. This was my takeaway from the movie. But at the same time, a lot of you are telling on yourselves by saying “the floating gun/parasite motif/bury your gays trope means absolutely nothing!”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this kind of discourse is part of the enjoyment one can derive from this film. Gun violence, especially of the school shooting variety is such a norm in America, that above comment is almost normalcy. This is hilarious! American family values are so in the gutter that people are seeing that the film has subtext of elders blaming things on the younger generation. Also, everything I do not like must be right wing! Somehow! It&rsquo;s almost astonishing that American people think this way. I think it&rsquo;s very amusing to hear them, it&rsquo;s like you are studying some bizarre social experiment. Oh? The witch killed a man? Must be because he was gay!</p>
<p>Cregger has denied that the film has any sort of gun violence or school shooting allegory. I mean sure. In any case, this film perfectly captures the WKUK spirit. Trevor would be proud.</p>
