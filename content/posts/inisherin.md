this got a bit too topical.

![let's call it quits](/images/post_pics/inisherin/k8azyHZ8T7bQeUh9GPnSfc5zA6.jpg)

it's not the best feeling when you realise you have been in the shoes of the both
asshole protagonists. i have been the one who abruptly ended friendships, and
i've been on the end of continuously nagging someone that they told me to fuck off.
and mind you, i deserved the latter every single time it happened.

## retrospective

this isn't a film review as much it's an retrospective of my own relationships with
people. truth be told, im not good at those. it'a shame, because although i proclaim
that i can live by myself, that being alone is my ground state, that i will be happy
doing that, despite all this, there's this innate desire to still part of a group. a
sense of belonging. but that is not a luxury, is it? how can one take this audacious
stance of being proud by ignoring others on his own whims and then desire contact all of
a sudden. it does not work like that.

the question one can ask is, what prompts someone to break all contact with someone?
in *Banshees*, Gleeson's character Colm cites a desire to leave something lasting before
he bodes for the hereafter. he plays the fiddle (a violin esentially), starts teaching
during his time once he stops chatting with Padraic. let me digress a bit though. this
actually happens a lot. a lonely person, comes in contact with someone they hit it right off,
and with time, the lonely one becomes obsessed with the other person to the point they are
unable to live normally without them. and the other person has to bear all the trauma
of harboring a leech like that. for the other person, the situation is akin to talking
to someone they thought would be good company but with time they realise that it was good
as a once-in-a-while thing, you cannot actually talk to this person the whole time.
i know this thouroughly. as i said, i have been on the both sides of the tussle.

## fickle as the wind

that's how humans are. i think the best option is to not think about things much.
the problem with Padraic was apparent. he did not have much going on with his life.
so when his friend departed (followed by sister), he had nothing left. don't put
all eggs in the same basket. if you can live by yourself, you can live. i think
that should be the point. to live. happiness is a state of the mind. if you *want*
to be happy, you will be happy. nothing can stop you. regarding Colm, it definitely was
not a very nice thing to do. the abruptness hurts, it really does. but if you have
other things going in your life, then all it takes is some time to get rid of that.

finally, a melody for all the friends out there:
