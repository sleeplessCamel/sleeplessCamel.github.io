- film starts with For all fathers, wherever they are. something tells me maybe im not ready for this one guys
- she's literally me
- fuck, i can't be a doctor like that
- a man obsessed with his work oblivious to the treasure he has in his life in the form of his daughter and wife. this is actually so great, with the way the whole background story is being set-up through a montage over a melancholic song.
- this is my only second Bengali film but i appreciate this so much that the creators do not consider the audience smooth-brained and don't spoonfed every plot point through dialogue
- we only remember the importance of something or someone when they are no longer there. may this be a lesson to cherish what you have right now.
- Lmao this Barun guy and his wife are just great friends
- okay okay okay are those real bengali directors cameos lmao
- holy shit i love this film's humor lmao. this director is just going full-on liberal on Himu's gang
- we have to keep telling the story, as storytellers, with all the life we have
- TIL about kashful
- nooooo google excel strikes here again ðŸ˜­

## dracula sir sighting

- there's this ucky feeling i have tho. can i really lie like that. i don't think I'll be able to
- fake festival was maybe fine. but fake mother feels too much
- fucking hell Dracula sir does play hateable characters very well lol
- Starring Dracula sir as Mahishasur himself lmao
- it really you hits you doesn't it. a story of two failed men trying finally to do one thing right in their life
- THE BIHARI GOON BRINGS THE WHOLE BIHAR ðŸ˜­
- when i started it, i went in expecting a story much more on the sad side, but i just loved how pleasant it turned out to be in the end.
- the real hero was the director.
- of course, i cried, but not because of the sadness, but because the actions of two failed men finally trying to do something right in their life moved me.
- only qualm was the handling of the real mother's character. the whole mother plotline didn't make sense to me
