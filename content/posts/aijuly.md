These days, the market has an oversupply of opinions on the state of artificial intelligence and its effects on the society. I am not going to help in combating that by writing another such opinion.

If the title implied that this article was going to be a recap or analysis of the models released in the summer of 2025 then I would be extremely pleased to disappoint you. You can please close this tab and leave. That said, we seem to be in an AI summer. The spring is over, and the fall beckons.
