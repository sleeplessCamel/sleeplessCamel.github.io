- oh he combs so much, im uncomfortable. few moments later scares the kid with unkempt hair and dracula snare lol
- i absolutely love the fact that even the songs are subtitled ü•π, and what a lovely song. the lyrics man. at this point im sure it's just hindi songs which have shitty lyrics
- bengalis and their attics. i am in love with this aesthetic and im almost on the verge of having nostalgia for something i never experienced myself
- it snows in Kolkata (and electric guitar plays, just why and how this film's soundtrack is so good lol)
- Raktim or ‡¶∞‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶Æ, the word for red, the red of the blood, name for someone who longs for it.
- the parallels. so many parallels. Ôº∞Ôº°Ôº≤Ôº°Ôº¨Ôº¨Ôº•Ôº¨Ôº≥.
- in stories where the line between reality and someone's imagination is blurred, the viewer themselves are required to detach from the world and immerse in the story.
- and the ending lol where the psychiatrist asks Raktim which character now he will be in his story and he is now suddenly the dead husband üò≠
- also the tear gas callback ü•π (yes this emoji was also met with tear gas)
- again, i am so impressed with the lyrics (everything else about the songs, but the lyrics especially). they're so many lines that just straight up foreshadow the events. so poetic
- i think at one point the doctors tells Raktim to write again. he rode the books on Naxalbari uprising, probably influence from his father as he got them from him. and of course, "Kolkata's Dracula" by some Haridas Bandyopadhyay. I wanted this to be a real book
- i like stories like these. life of pi comes to my mind. there's one version which is rational, plausible, logical. but it's lame. the charm lies in the fantastical. a story of a revolutionary, torn between love and war, reincarnated to complete his revenge and redeem himself. what really happened is secondary, what really matters is what the viewer chooses to believe in
- i have probably many many more things to say, but my eyes keep closing and i have to somehow survive till lunch, so the words aren't really coming out right now. i would love to talk about the film more later in person lol
