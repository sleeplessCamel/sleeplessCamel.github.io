RIP David.

I had to write this one. This one, a celebrity death finally managed to make me sad.
I quite don't know why though. My first introduction to him was what? Twin Peaks? Yeah, it was probably that.
What else could it be!

I discovered Twin Peaks after Gravity Falls. So it's something very close to my heart, in how I feel
about them. Man, David, I wonder if [you had actually voiced Bill Cipher](https://www.themarysue.com/gravity-falls-rewatch-recap-dreamscaperers/). But I digress. This is not about Twin Peaks or Gravity Falls.
It's about the emotions Lynch evoked in his works. Here is the thing: I feel affected by his passing,
yet I don't really recall talking him about very much. Sure, I absolutely adore his work, but I was
not a hardcore fan. Ah of course, that is not a requirement to feel sad about someone's passing.
You don't need much for that. Just a little bit empathy, that's all it takes. But no, let me
put it this way: there are way more celebrity people that I may have spent my energy on and yet I would
feel not much remorse. But there are some people, who take shelter in your thoughts subconsciously.
Irrfan Khan was one of them. Lynch was another. The work stays with you. Their creations stay with you.

And maybe there's a lesson to never disown your creations here. Oh it all comes back. Well back to work.

I brought coffee today, finally. See you at the Roadhouse, David.
